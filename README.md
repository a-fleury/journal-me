# JournalMe 📔

A fun AI-powered journaling application that makes tracking your life events as easy as having a conversation. Talk to an AI to log events, summarize your day or week, and get reminders about when you last did something.

Note: This is a school project with a playful twist on authentication - you can literally tell the LLM your credentials and it will log you in! 🎉 (Not recommended for production use, obviously!)

## Features

* 🗣️ **Conversational Journaling** - Simply talk to the AI to record your daily events
* 📊 **Smart Summaries** - Get AI-generated summaries of your day, week, or custom time periods
* 🔔 **Activity Reminders** - Ask when you last did something and get instant answers
* 🎭 **Fun Authentication** - Just tell the AI your email and password, and it handles the login!

## Tech Stack

* **Scala 3.3.7** - Modern, functional programming
* **Chimp** (v0.1.6) - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server framework
* **Tapir** (v1.13.2) - Type-safe API endpoints
* **Netty** - HTTP server
* **Logback** - Logging

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Java SDK 21
* sbt (Scala Build Tool)
* [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/) - Required for using JournalMe's MCP integration

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd JournalMe
```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Add your required environment variables here
# (e.g., API keys, database URLs, etc.)
```

3. **Build the project**

```bash
sbt compile
```

4. **Run the application**

```bash
sbt run
```

### Using with Cursor IDE

Since JournalMe uses Chimp for MCP (Model Context Protocol), you'll need to use Cursor IDE to interact with the JournalMe MCP server in your AI chat sessions.

* Open the project in Cursor
* Configure the MCP connection in Cursor's settings
* Start chatting with the AI and use JournalMe's capabilities!

### Project Structure

```
JournalMe/
├── src/              # Source code
├── project/          # sbt build configuration
├── target/           # Compiled artifacts (ignored)
├── build.sbt         # Project dependencies and settings
└── .env              # Environment variables (ignored)
```

## Development Notes

* The `.bloop`, `.bsp`, and `.metals` directories are generated by Metals (Scala language server)
* Build artifacts are automatically ignored via `.gitignore`
* Make sure your `.env` file is never committed to version control

## Contributing

This is a school project, but feel free to experiment and have fun with it! Just remember: the authentication method is intentionally silly - please don't use this pattern in real applications! 😄

**Happy Journaling! ✨**
